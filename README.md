# Notes

- You can test the payment simulation method with [PurchaseServiceTest.java](src%2Ftest%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Flydiasystems%2Fchallenge%2Fservice%2FPurchaseServiceTest.java)
- All product CRUD operations are working.
- Spring security implemented with JWT.
- A product cant be sold more than its stock.
- I wrote unit test classes for Controllers and Service classes.
- Created a React app for showing product and sold products.(No attention was paid to design.)
